# ReciclerView-CardView
Here we are gonna create a simple example with recicler view with data that could be download from Internet.

# CARD VIEW as a Holder 

The Idea is to create the recicler view and in order to show the information in it we will use CardView.

# ReciclerView-Adapter

We need to create a class that is gonna manage our indefinite list of elements. (extends RecyclerView.Adapter<Here Goes holder Class> )

#  ReciclerView-Holder

We need to create a class that holds our data and make it visually atractive, in this section we will use a Card View.
